# Inline entity form

Entity browser integrates with [Inline entity form module](https://drupal.org/project/inline_entity_form) (entity_browser_entity_form submodule). There are two ways the two modules can be combined.
 
## Entity browser widget

Entity browser comes with a "Entity form" widget that uses "Inline entity form" form element to build entity creation forms. This allows users to create new entities of any type from inside of an arbitrary entity browser.

## Reference existing entity on IEF

Entity browser can inject itself into Inline entity form and replace standard autocomplete textfield that is used to reference existing entities form IEF.

This allows site builders to create nicer and more powerful experience for content creators.
