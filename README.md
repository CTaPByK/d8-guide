# Drupal Media Handbook

## How to contribute to the documentation

If you have trouble understanding any part of the documentation, please notify those of us who work on this section by [creating an issue on our Media handbook repository](https://github.com/drupal-media/handbook/issues) and clearly explain what you don't understand and why - we're happy to hear from you, your contribution helps everyone at Drupal!

You can also contribute directly on our [Media handbook repository](https://github.com/drupal-media/handbook) by editing the files through the [GitHub](https://github.com/) interface directly in your browser. Alternatively, you can clone the repository and edit the book in your favorite text editor or in the official [GitBook desktop app](https://github.com/GitbookIO/editor).
